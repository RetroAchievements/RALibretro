Speex website indicates it has been superceded by Opus, but Opus documentation specifically 
states it does not have a resampler, and points back at Speex:

https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opusfile/-/blob/master/include/opusfile.h#L59-62

    (the <tt>libopusfile</tt> API does not currently provide a resampler, but
    <a href="https://www.speex.org/docs/manual/speex-manual/node7.html#SECTION00760000000000000000">the
    Speex resampler</a> is a good choice if you need one)
